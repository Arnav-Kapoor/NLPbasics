      "What childishness he wouldn't give way to. \n",
      "He manages to keep the upper hand \n",
      "On his own farm. He's boss. But as to hens: \n",
      "We fence our flowers in and the hens range. \n",
      "Nothing's too good for them. We say it pays. \n",
      "John likes to tell the offers he has had, \n",
      "Twenty for this cock, twenty-five for that. \n",
      "He never takes the money. If they're worth \n",
      "That much to sell, they're worth as much to keep. \n",

      "The upper shelf, the tin box. That's the one. \n",
      "I'll show you. Here you are.' \n",
      "'What's this?' \n",
      "'A bill- \n",
      "For fifty dollars for one Langshang cock- \n",
      "Receipted. And the cock is in the yard.' \n",
      "'Not in a glass case, then?' \n",
      "'He'd need a tall one: \n",
      "He can eat off a barrel from the ground. \n",
      "He's been in a glass case, as you may say, \n",
      "The Crystal Palace, London. He's imported. \n",
      "John bought him, and we paid the bill with beads- \n",
      "Wampum, I call it. Mind, we don't complain. \n",
      "But you see, don't you, we take care of him.' \n",
      "'And like it, too. It makes it all the worse.' \n",
      "'It seems as if. And that's not all: he's helpless \n",
      "In ways that I can hardly tell you of. \n",
      "Sometimes he gets possessed to keep accounts \n",
      "To see where all the money goes so fast. \n",
      "You know how men will be ridiculous. \n",
      "But it's just fun the way he gets bedeviled- \n",
      "If he's untidy now, what will he be- - ? \n",
      "'It makes it all the worse. You must be blind.' \n",
      "'Estelle's the one. You needn't talk to me.' \n",

      "What's the real trouble? What will satisfy her?' \n",
      "'It's as I say: she's turned from him, that's all.' \n",
      "'But why, when she's well off? Is it the neighbours, \n",
      "Being cut off from friends?' \n",
      "'We have our friends. \n",
      "That isn't it. Folks aren't afraid of us.' \n",

      "But I got wonted to it. And besides- \n",
      "John said I was too old to have grandchildren. \n",
      "But what's the use of talking when it's done? \n",
      "She won't come back- it's worse than that- she can't.' \n",
